This program will take the radii of three pieces of three different snowman and
calculate the volume of all three snowmen
Inputs: 9 radii
Outputs: Papa Volume, Mama Volume, Baby Volume, Family Volume
Formulas: Volume = 4/3*PI*r^3

start
REPEAT three times
    snowman = 0
    IF snowman is equal to 0
        REPEAT three times
            ask user for radius of nth body part of papa snowman
            Add 4/3*PI*radius^3 to papa volume
        ENDREPEAT
        output papa volume
    ELSE snowman is equal to 1
        REPEAT three times
            ask user for radius of nth body part of mama snowman
            Add 4/3*PI*radius^3 to mama volume
        ENDREPEAT
        output mama volume
    ELSE snowman is equal to 2
        REPEAT three times
            ask user for radius of nth body part of baby snowman
            Add 4/3*PI*radius^3 to baby volume
        ENDREPEAT
        output baby volume
    ENDIF
    increase snowman by 1
ENDREPEAT
add papa volume, mama volume, and baby volume together to make family volume
output family volume
