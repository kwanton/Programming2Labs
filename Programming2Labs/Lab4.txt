This program will be a game about guiding a pig on a 10x10 grid
Inputs: X Start Position, Y Start Position, Move Direction
Outputs: None
Formulas: None

start
create a 2d array for the grid map
REPEAT until starting location is not out of bounds
	ask user for starting location
ENDREPEAT
REPEAT if truffle location and starting location are the same.
	generate a random location in array for where truffle is
ENDREPEAT
set starting location to current location
place current location under visited
REPEAT 10 times or if a game over occurs
	clear screen
	REPEAT 10 times for x axis
		REPEAT 10 times for y axis
			IF current space is current location
				output an "@"
			ELSE
				IF current space is visited
					output an "x"
				ENDIF
			ELSE
				output a "o"
			ENDIF
		ENDREPEAT
	ENDREPEAT
	REPEAT for spaces to left, center, and to right on the x-axis
		REPEAT for spaces to left, center, to right on the y-axis
			IF no adjacent spaces can be moved towards
				set game over to true
				set lost to true
			ENDIF
		ENDREPEAT
	ENDREPEAT
	IF lost is false
		output "the direction of the truffle is..."
		IF current location y > truffle location y
			output "north"
		ELSE
			IF current location y < truffle location y
				output "south"
		ENDIF
		IF current location x < truffle location x
			output "east"
		ELSE
			IF current location x > truffle location x
				output "west"
		ENDIF
		REPEAT until next location is not out of bounds or on a visited space
			ask player for move direction
			calculate next location from move direction
		ENDREPEAT
		set current location to next location
		IF current location is the same as truffle location
			set game over to true
			set win to true
		ELSE
			place current location under visited
		ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDREPEAT
IF win is true
	congratulate player on victory
ELSE
	IF lost is true
		inform player that they got stuck and couldn't move anywhere else
	ENDIF
ELSE
	inform player that they died of starvation and should feel bad
