Output: receit, total
Formulas: subtotal * 1.08 = total

start
set precision to 2, show point, and set fixed
create item structure array (length 9) with stock number, description and price variables
define input file
open input file
REPEAT 9 times
    create a new structure
    read the input file and add stock number to structure
    read the input file and add description to structure
    read the input file and add price to structure
ENDREPEAT
close input file
sort structures by stock number
REPEAT until stock input is equal to 0
    set found item to false
    ask user for a stock input and let them know "0" will calculate a total
    REPEAT until found item is true or if has repeated nine times or if stock
    input is equal to 0
        IF stock input is equal to stock number in current array
            set found item to true

output subtotal
set total equal to subtotal * 1.08
output total
set amount owed equal to total
REPEAT while amount owed is greater than zero
    ask for tender amount
    IF tender amount is equal to or less than 0
        output error message
    ELSE
        amount owed - tender amount
