# Programming2Labs
These are my labs from my October 2019 Programming 2 class.

For each lab, there is a txt file which contains the required psuedocode for each lab, a .exe for running said lab, and of course, the .cpp source file for the lab.

Note: For labs 1 and 5, they require the stock.txt file to be alongside the source code in the same folder. If labs 1 or 5 are run all the way through, they will both create a sales.txt file in the same folder that they both reside in.

Note: For lab 6, there is a Cadets.txt file that is used. This is a list of cadets that was used for a sorting algorithm in lab 6.
